# Data-Modelling-and-Analysis-in-R
This is my project for my Bachelor Thesis! It is an econometric model on the effect of the 2008 crisis, at a macroeconomic level, on Romania.

I have uploaded the code, the output, the dataset and the analysis. Unfortunately I couldn't include the graphs, as they are not supported by the platform.
